A short exercise provided at the end of a short Artificial Inteligence & Machine Learning Bootcamp offered at Strathmore University Nairobi. 

This focused on the use of Python in machine learning and taugh about the Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas modules which are then used to explore the dataset provided.The exercise has been completed using jupyter notebook.

Below are the questions. screenshots have also been attached to assist with visualization. 

Explore the dataset on Californiaâ€™s cities following the instructions below.
Extra points will be awarded to students who document their code well and demonstrate originality of thought.

1. Check for null values								2mks
2. If there are null values replace them with either the (mean, medium, mode) of each column or drop all the rows altogether					4mks
3. What is the mean, max, min, std, medium of the ten lowest values of 
latitude values									4mks
4. Display the ten cities with the least value of elevation in Meters		3mks
5. What are the top ten cities with the highest population totals		2mks
6. Plot the relationship of the top ten highest areas in feet with their respective population totals										3mks
7. Plot the relationship of the top ten cities in feet with their respective 
population totals								3mks
8. Plot a histogram of the area_total_sq_mi and describe the pattern of the data (you can use 20 bins for the histogram plot)						2mks
9. Normalize the values of the area_total_sq_mi, plot a histogram of the values and describe the pattern of the data after normalization.					3mks
10. Using a plot analyze the relationship of the population total by the area 
total in sq mi									3mks
11. Assuming population_total to be our target value, fit the data onto a linear regression model and evaluate the performance of the model				6mks
